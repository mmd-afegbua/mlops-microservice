# Udacity Cloud DevOps Engineer Nanodegree - Operationalizing a Machine Learning Microservice API
## Overview of Project

This project is `python flask app`that runs a machie learning api, designed to run on three different services; locally, on docker as a contain and on kubernetes - as a container too. The api is that of a pre-trained sklearn model that predicts housing prices in Boston according to available data. I wish I could talk more on the API but that is not why I am writing this. Incase you want to check it out, visit https://www.kaggle.com/c/boston-housing.

## Aim of Project

The aim is to operationalize the machine learning api as a microservice using kubernetes - ultimately - and to xarry out linting tests using CircleCi
