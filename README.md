# Udacity Cloud DevOps Engineer Nanodegree - Operationalize a Machine Learning Microservice API
## Overview of Project

This project is a machie learning api that is designed to run on three different services; locally, on docker as a contain and on kubernetes - as a container too. The api is that of a pre-trained sklearn model that predicts housing prices in Boston according to available data. I wish I could talk more on the API but that is not why I am writing this. Incase you want to check it out, visit https://www.kaggle.com/c/boston-housing.
